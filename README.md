# A.R.M. - Above-Elbow 3D-Printed Low-Cost Prosthetic

**Customizable Above-Elbow 3D-Printed Low-Cost Prosthetics**

By Queen's Biomedical Innovation Team (QBiT), the Perk Lab and Med-i Lab from Queen's University.

In collaboration with Burma Children Medical Fund (BCMF), a nonprofit based in Mae Sot, Tak, Thailand. BCMF focuses on funding medical treatment and support services, including accessible prosthetics for refugees and underserved Burmese communities along the Thai-Myanmar border. 

Our partnership focuses on designing and developing low-cost, 3D-printed, body-powered prosthetics. The labs provide both remote and on-site technical support and have sent three students to work in Mae Sot with BCMF so far.

This repository contains the CAD models and harness manual for our fully body-powered above-elbow prosthetic. The device is to be fabricated using locally available materials and support the everyday functional needs of patients.

# Features

• Fully body-powered design

• Made with materials accessible in-clinic

• Capable of assisting with common daily tasks

• Lightweight and easy to reproduce

• Total estimated material cost: $8.23–13.23 USD per device

• Open-source and adaptable for future development

# Files Included

• 5 CAD files for prosthetic components

• Harness system instructions and design notes

• Cost breakdown and materials list

• Preliminary testing results and feedback highlights

# In Progress

• Video demonstration of device assembly and usage will be added soon

• Ongoing testing with patients at BCMF in Thailand (April–August 2025)

• Planned integration into clinic workflow and future iterations for improved elbow movement and durability

• Movement of 5 fingers and interchangable end effectors will be added in the 2025-2026 school term
